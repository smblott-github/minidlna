This is just a copy of minidlna (1.1.5) with a couple of tweaks.

Tweaks:

   - For the "force_sort_criteria" config option, you can also
     say "+upnp:name" to sort by the file name.

   - Added a flag "-D" which *prevents* minidlna from daemonising, but
     doesn't also turn onn all of the debug flags.

   - For videos, video titles are marked with a leading "* " when more
     than 90% of the video has been played.

     For this to work, you need to also run ./script/mark-seen.py (with
     the database name as an argument) from cron.

There's a fair amount of hackery going on, so YMMV.

Here's the original README...
